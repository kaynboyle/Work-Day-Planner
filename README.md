deployed app: https://kaynboyle.github.io/Work-Day-Planner/
 This application marks the hours as current past and future. The text boxes change in color to mark the hours. The daily calendar includes timeblocks for a regular 9-5 work day. 
 
 Notes can be added for tasks to complete at each hour. Users will input a task and press the save button. The task is saved in local storage and remains on the page even when the page is reloaded.
